\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my tutor at DIPF, Mr Ivan Habernal for his availability and advises during this internship. I would like also to thank my tutor at \'Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Mr Alexandre Saidi for his advises during the past year for both the final year at ECL and the double degree at Universit\'e Lyon 1.

Finally, I would address a thank to all the people working at UKP in Darmstadt and DIPF in Frankfurt with one thought for my co-workers Tahir, Neil, and Cl\'ement and my office neighbours Ahc\`ene and Daniel.
