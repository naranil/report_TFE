\section*{Abstract}
The goal of this work is the identification of persuasive and argumentative documents in user generated content, namely discussion forums and article comments. We have at our disposal a human-annotated corpus of size 990 documents enriched with metadata (topic, source, creation date) and classified as either persuasive (class P1) or non-persuasive (class P2).

We clearly have a binary classification problem. It will be the opportunity to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to process and extract useful knowledge from textual data, engineer fancy features to describe the data and finally utilize machine learning tools and evaluate our model predictions. Most of the tasks, from data processing to binary classification were performed thank to DKPro, a NLP software developed by the UKP laboratory.
