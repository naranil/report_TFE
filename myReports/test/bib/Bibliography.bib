	abstract = {In this paper, we argue that an annotation scheme for argumentation mining
is a function of the task requirements and the corpus properties. There is
no one-size-fits-all argumentation theory to be applied to realistic data
on the Web. In two annotation studies, we experiment with 80 German
newspaper editorials from the Web and about one thousand English documents
from forums, comments, and blogs. Our example topics are taken from the
educational domain.
To formalize the problem of annotating arguments, in the first case, we
apply a Claim-Premise scheme, and in the second case, we modify Toulmin's
scheme. We find that the choice of the argument components to be annotated
strongly depends on the register, the length of the document, and
inherently on the literary devices and structures used for expressing
argumentation. We hope that these findings will facilitate the creation of
reliably annotated argumentation corpora for a wide range of tasks and
corpus types and will help to bridge the gap between argumentation theories
and actual application needs.},
