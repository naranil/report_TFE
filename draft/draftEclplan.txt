Plan pour le rapport ECL:

Front Page: Titre (2 langues ?), logo of TUD and ECL, names of professors, ect...?

Abstract: prendre example sur le papier de Ivan, et faire un abstract en Anglais puis Francais.

Acknowledgement.

Content (how many parts ?)
List of Figures ?

Introduction: my internship, collaboration with Lyon 1 Uni, Darmstadt+DIPF, team. Then introduction to deep learning and argumentation mining, the classification task and the framework used (DKPro TC).

Background:

- Data used: the corpus of 990 art-comment/forum texts of 6 different topics (and its meta-data: topic, type, creation date). 
- Gold data: human classification task, describe (more or less briefly) the annotation guideline and also the theory about stances and all... Scores and why we can initiate a machine classification. -> Citation ?
- Technology used: Describe DKPro, Java implementation of UIMA and give details about TC (Weka, ect...). How we're using this framework and stress the fact that we enriched it (example sentiment analysis) -> papers about DKPro
- Weka's library and the classifier we use (SVM: description) -> Citation
- How we evaluate our classification: metrics (TP, FP, ect...), Accuracy, F-mes for all different cases (Full CV, In Domain CV, Cross Domain, Full Cross Domain). How the F-measures are implemented -> cite some articles, ask Ivan

Our work:
- Feature engineering: all the features implemented (citations when it's not how feature). Formula, software engineering, ect...
- Results for different features
- Bootstrapping
- Error analysis (problematic instances humans VS instances)
- Feature selection

Conclusion and further work
